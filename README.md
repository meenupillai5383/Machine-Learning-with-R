Here, we are aiming to revolutionize the way banks handle loan applications by incorporating machine learning (ML) automation.The motivation behind this revolution is emerged by the understanding the complexity of handling numerous loan applications at the same time, in this fast-paced world.With a large influx of loan applications, manually reviewing each of them has become impossible. It is not only time-consuming but also prone to human errors. By implementing ML models, we aim to make this process more efficient by defining some predefined criteria with the help of machine learning models.
